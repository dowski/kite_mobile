# Kite Mobile

The Kite news app for iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

Use `flutter run` to launch the app.

## Principles

 * Lightweight
 * Minimal data use
 * Handle flaky networks

## Tests

There's a stronger focus on widget tests that exercise multiple parts of
the app code together vs. unit tests (although there are some of those).
